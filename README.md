# Landing page project for udacity

The project is for a sample of landing page which should allow us to have a real world experience of developing a small landing page for a website.

In this project we have 4 sections each section has a shortcut to it using the navbar,
so by clicking on the section number from the navbar you will automatically get scrolled down to the section content.
